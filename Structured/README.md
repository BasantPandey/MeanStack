# Mean Stack Development: [Address Book](https://boiling-cliffs-28700.herokuapp.com/)
This is very simple Address book example using Mean Stack. This project for  entry level developer who just started to learn Mean Stack.

Today's world is full of JavaScript. In this mean stack we developed fully JavaScript development start to end.As we know Mean stands for M: Mongodb, E: Express, A: Angular and N: nodejs. All it Self are very popular and support JavaScript for development and deployment.

### Mean: A complete stack for Javascript, comprised of MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.

* MongoDB: MongoDB for a schema-optional, "NoSQL" data store - perfectly suited for working with JSON data.
* Express: Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
* AngularJS: AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
* Node.js: Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

### NPM dependency
1. Mongoose
1. body-parser
1. angular
1. bootstrap

### Web Hosting 

* Heroku: Heroku is a cloud Platform-as-a-Service supporting several programming languages. Heroku was acquired by Salesforce.com in 2010.
* mLab: mLab's MongoDB hosting platform is the fastest growing cloud database-as-a-service in the world.
